<p style = 'line-height:2;text-indent:50px;'>	The main idea that this book discusses <span style='background-color:yellow'>is</span> the topic of  “thin slicing”. A sentence should not end in <span style='background-color:yellow'>like</span>? Another test for <span style='background-color:yellow'>like</span>! <span style='background-color:yellow'>First</span> <span style='background-color:yellow'>is</span> a dead word. Thin slicing <span style='background-color:yellow'>is</span> basically the innate ability of the human subconscious to take in sensory cues, such as <span style='background-color:yellow'>sounds</span> and sights, and make a judgement or decision based on the little information gathered. The way the book presents thin slicing <span style='background-color:yellow'>is</span> as an alternative to strenuous data collection, which the author deems as unreliable. The first example of thin slicing given <span style='background-color:yellow'>is</span> in the case of a Kouros statue purchased by the Getty museum. The researchers and scientists that analyzed the statue believed it to <span style='background-color:yellow'>be</span> true <span style='background-color:yellow'>due to</span> months of research and testing. <span style='background-color:yellow'>However</span>, when shown to art historians and professionals, they <span style='background-color:yellow'>were</span> able to deduce instantly that the statue <span style='background-color:yellow'>was</span> fake, subverting months of careful research. They did this through thin slicing, <span style='background-color:yellow'>because</span> they <span style='background-color:yellow'>were</span> able to pick up on abnormalities in the statue that their experience had taught them and they <span style='background-color:yellow'>were</span> able to make a conclusion based upon that. Thin slicing occurs in what the book calls the “locked door”, or our unconscious mind. One caveat <span style='background-color:yellow'>is</span> that while a trained mind <span style='background-color:yellow'>is</span> able to accurately thin slice, the reasons for the conclusion that one’s subconscious ends up on <span style='background-color:yellow'>are</span> often unknown to the person. An example <span style='background-color:yellow'>is</span> the case of Vic Braden, who <span style='background-color:yellow'>is</span> a world renowned tennis player. Vic <span style='background-color:yellow'>is</span> able to know exactly when a tennis player <span style='background-color:yellow'>is</span> <span style='background-color:yellow'>about</span> to mess up on a serve, but he can’t delineate what part of the server’s mechanics leads him to that conclusion. The unconscious <span style='background-color:yellow'>is</span> a <span style='background-color:yellow'>very</span> powerful tool and another one of its abilities <span style='background-color:yellow'>is</span> to prime the body based on visual cues. The author cites a study in which the subjects <span style='background-color:yellow'>were</span> to read a sentence with subtle hits at elderliness. The readers’ unconscious region of the brain then picks up on these hints and as a result, when the reader left the room, the demeanor of his walk <span style='background-color:yellow'>was</span> similar to that of an old person. This <span style='background-color:yellow'>is</span> known as priming and it <span style='background-color:yellow'>is</span> <span style='background-color:yellow'>something</span> else that the unconscious part of our mind can do. </p>
<p style = 'line-height:2;text-indent:50px;'>	Another example of thin slicing prevailing over careful research <span style='background-color:yellow'>is</span> in the case of Paul Van Riper and the Millenium Challenge. This <span style='background-color:yellow'>was</span> a simulation in which Riper <span style='background-color:yellow'>was</span> playing the part of a rogue militant. The US team would have access to state of the art military technology, while Riper’s team had outdated or <span style='background-color:yellow'>very</span> basic technology. In the end, Riper won the challenge <span style='background-color:yellow'>due to</span> the fact that thin slicing all his decisions gave Riper the advantage in terms of decision speed, since the other group would move slowly and would take into consideration every piece of data, no matter how gratuitous it may <span style='background-color:yellow'>be</span>. The next aspect of thin slicing the book considers <span style='background-color:yellow'>is</span> that sometimes, the untrained mind can thin slice incorrectly <span style='background-color:yellow'>due to</span> a lack of knowledge or experience. This <span style='background-color:yellow'>is</span> demonstrated in the case of Kenna Zemendkun. He <span style='background-color:yellow'>is</span> a musician that many record produces and musicians love; however, his music <span style='background-color:yellow'>was</span> not acclaimed by the regular people that listened to it in test groups. For this reason, his music <span style='background-color:yellow'>was</span> not played on the radio and he <span style='background-color:yellow'>was</span> not able to garner much success. The reason <span style='background-color:yellow'>was</span> <span style='background-color:yellow'>because</span> Kenna’s music <span style='background-color:yellow'>was</span> new and that the normal mind <span style='background-color:yellow'>was</span> not able to make sense of it, leading them to thin slice it in a negative way. The final example that the book presents us <span style='background-color:yellow'>is</span> in the case when thin slicing fails to work. This occurs under situations of high stress, when we <span style='background-color:yellow'>are</span> not able to focus on the facial expressions of others. This essentially renders us temporarily autistic and leads to worse judgement as a result. </p>
<p style = 'line-height:2;text-indent:50px;'>	An example in my life that reflects the subject matter <span style='background-color:yellow'>is</span> when I play soccer. In the book, the author says that when one starts trying to go through the reasons for why his or her unconscious mind did <span style='background-color:yellow'>something</span>, the person’s performance suffers as a result. In short, if <span style='background-color:yellow'>you</span> think <span style='background-color:yellow'>about</span> it too much, it’ll end up hurting <span style='background-color:yellow'>you</span>. When I first started playing soccer, this <span style='background-color:yellow'>was</span> my predicament. Whenever the ball came <span style='background-color:yellow'>to me</span>, I would <span style='background-color:yellow'>look</span> around, trying to gather as much information as possible and make a decision based on this information. <span style='background-color:yellow'>However</span>, <span style='background-color:yellow'>like</span> the US in the war game, this took far too much time and I ended up messing up. Eventually, through experience, I have learned to take an account of my surroundings before the ball came and make decisions hastily, giving me time to react and execute. This led to a much higher rate of success for me. </p>
<p style = 'line-height:2;text-indent:50px;'>	Another example in my life that reflects the subject matter <span style='background-color:yellow'>is</span> when it comes to music <span style='background-color:yellow'>taste</span>. Usually when I listen to a song, within 10 seconds, I <span style='background-color:yellow'>am</span> able to deduce whether I <span style='background-color:yellow'>like</span> the song or not. This <span style='background-color:yellow'>is</span> <span style='background-color:yellow'>because</span> my unconscious thin slices the song, seeing if it matches the criteria that constitute a <span style='background-color:yellow'>good</span> song for me. <span style='background-color:yellow'>However</span>, it <span style='background-color:yellow'>is</span> quite hard to pinpoint exactly what this criteria <span style='background-color:yellow'>is</span>. This <span style='background-color:yellow'>is</span> discussed in detail in the book, such as in the case of the tennis serves.</p>
<p style = 'line-height:2;text-indent:50px;'>	One important detail that the book stresses over and over again <span style='background-color:yellow'>is</span> that the mind can learn to <span style='background-color:yellow'><span style='background-color:yellow'>become</span></span> better at thin slicing through repeated exposure. For instance, it says that one can even learn to thin slice effectively in times of high stress to avoid making fatal errors. Some security companies repeatedly subject their employees to these kinds of tests to make them have <span style='background-color:yellow'>good</span> judgement in stressful situations. In the book, it <span style='background-color:yellow'>is</span> also stated that if one takes the time to learn the complexities of the human face, it <span style='background-color:yellow'>is</span> possible to thin slice what a person <span style='background-color:yellow'>is</span> feeling according to their facial expressions. Even when a person <span style='background-color:yellow'>is</span> trying to fake their facial expressions, it <span style='background-color:yellow'>is</span> possible to gather data on how the person <span style='background-color:yellow'>is</span> actually feeling. My question <span style='background-color:yellow'>is</span> whether it’s possible for the reverse to <span style='background-color:yellow'>be</span> true. Is it possible for a person to train their face to completely fake an expression that can throw off even the most experienced face reader <span style='background-color:yellow'>about</span> his or her emotional state? If this <span style='background-color:yellow'>were</span> to happen, it would <span style='background-color:yellow'>be</span> much easier for criminals to <span style='background-color:yellow'>get</span> away with lying in court. It would also address a privacy concerns <span style='background-color:yellow'>about</span> reading into other people’s minds.</p>
<p style = 'line-height:2;text-indent:50px;'>	The final question I have towards the subject matter discussed <span style='background-color:yellow'>is</span> that <span style='background-color:yellow'>is</span> there a way to <span style='background-color:yellow'>get</span> people with autism to correct some of their shortcomings by staying calm? My reasoning behind this question lies in the fact that the book portrays those with autism as those who <span style='background-color:yellow'>are</span> unable to read the facial expressions of humans and as a result, can not comprehend emotions <span style='background-color:yellow'>being</span> conveyed through facial expressions. The author also states that people without autism do this when they <span style='background-color:yellow'>are</span> in a stressful situation that causes their heart rate to jump. My question <span style='background-color:yellow'>is</span> that since it <span style='background-color:yellow'>is</span> easier for people without autism to thin slice when they <span style='background-color:yellow'>are</span> relaxed and have a low heart rate, <span style='background-color:yellow'>is</span> it possible to slowly cultivate this ability in people with autism through therapy in which they <span style='background-color:yellow'>are</span> subjected to a low stress environment?</p>
